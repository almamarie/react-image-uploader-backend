# Getting Started

Frontend application can be found at <https://github.com/almamarie/image-upload-component.git>

Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.
Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:

```json
{
"success": False,
"error": 400,

The API will return three error types when requests fail:

400: Bad Request
404: Resource Not Found
